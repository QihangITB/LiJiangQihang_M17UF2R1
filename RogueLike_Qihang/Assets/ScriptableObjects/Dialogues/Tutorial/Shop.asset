  - "This is the store and I am the seller, you will see me during the trip.\r"
  - "I have many products for you that will be of great help, but nothing is free.\r"
  - "Each product will have its own value, here the value is measured with coins,
    at the top right of the interface you can see your amount of coins right now.\r"
  - To buy an item you must have the same or more coins than the cost of the item.
    If not you won't be able to buy it
  - "\rIf you have enough coins, approach the item to buy it."
  - In the inventory you can see all your items, you can remove and equip it, but
    you can't equip the same item twice or more.
  - "Oh, I see you're in trouble\u2026\r"
  - "Don't worry, since this is the first time I see you, I will give you 20 coins,
    but this will never happen again, because you have to get the coins yourself
    by killing enemies.\r"
  - Oh! Enemies... In the next room I will explain who they are.
