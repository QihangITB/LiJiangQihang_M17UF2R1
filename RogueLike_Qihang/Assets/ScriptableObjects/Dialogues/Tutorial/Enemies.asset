  - "Now a days we have only discovered two types of enemies. Both are dangerous.\r"
  - "At the top you will find the turret enemy.\r"
  - 'This enemy has the following stats: Health - 3 / Coins - 2 / Damage - 1'
  - "The turrets doesn't move, they are static.\r"
  - "They will aim randomly until they spot an adventurer. If they spot you, you
    can hide behind an obstacle.\r"
  - "And at the bottom you will find the bomber enemy.\r"
  - 'This enemy has the following stats: Health - 2 / Coins - 1 / Damage - 2'
  - "The bombers can move around the map, because they patrol there. \r"
  - If they detect an adventurer, they will chase him until reach him and explode.
    But don't worry, you can use obstacles or run faster to get out of their sight.
  - If you kill these enemies, you will get the coins.
