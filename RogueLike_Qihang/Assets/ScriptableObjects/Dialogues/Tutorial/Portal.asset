  - "The little lake is very pretty... Oh you are here!\r"
  - Well, what you see here is the portal.
  - To open it you need a yellow key like this one on the right.
  - "\rNow the portal is red it means it is closed, when you take the key the color
    will be change."
  - If the portal is open and you entered you will be transferred to another place,
    so you will not be able to return.
  - Are you ready to start?
